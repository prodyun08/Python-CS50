# Improving Your First Python Program

We can personalize your first Python program.

In our text editor in `hello.py`, we can add another function. `input()` is a function that takes a prompt as an argument. We can edit our code to say:

```python
input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, world")
```

# Variables
A variable is just a container for a value within your program. You can introduce a variable in your program by editing it to read:

* We can personalize your first Python program.
* In our text editor in hello.py we can add another function. input is a function that takes a prompt as an argument. We can edit our code to say

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, world")
```
* This edit alone, however, will not allow your program to output what your user inputs. For that, we will need to introduce you to variables
