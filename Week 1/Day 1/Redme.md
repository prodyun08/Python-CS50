# Improving Your First Python Program

We can personalize your first Python program.

In our text editor in `hello.py`, we can add another function. `input()` is a function that takes a prompt as an argument. We can edit our code to say:

```python
input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, world")
```

# Variables
* A variable is just a container for a value within your own program.
* In your program, you can introduce your own variable in your program by editing it to read

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, world")
```

* Notice that this equal `=` sign in the middle of `name = input("What's your name? ")` has a special role in programming. This equal sign literally assigns what is on the right to what is on the left. Therefore, the value returned by `input("What's your name? ")` is assigned to `name`.

* If you edit your code as follows, you will notice an error

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, name")
```

* The program will return `hello, name` in the terminal window regardless of what the user types.
Further editing our code, you could type

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello,")
print(name)
```
* The result in the terminal window would be

```python
What's your name? Prodyun
hello
Prodyun
```
* We are getting closer to the result we might intend!
